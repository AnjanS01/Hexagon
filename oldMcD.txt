And on that farm he had some chickens
E-i-e-i-o
With a cluck-cluck here
And a cluck-cluck there
Here a cluck, there a cluck
Everywhere a cluck-cluck
Moo-moo here
And a moo-moo there
Here a moo, there a moo
Everywhere a moo-moo
Old MacDonald had a farm
E-i-e-i-o

Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O,
And on that farm he had a cow, E-I-E-I-O,
With a moo moo here and a moo moo there,
Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo moo,
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O.


Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
And on that farm he had a duck, E-I-E-I-O
With a quack-quack here and a quack-quack there
Here a quack, there a quack, everywhere a quack-quack
Oink-oink here and a oink-oink there
Here a oink, there a oink, everywhere a oink-oink
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O.
