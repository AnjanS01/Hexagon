Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O,
And on that farm he had a cow, E-I-E-I-O,
With a moo moo here and a moo moo there,
Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo moo,
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O.

Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O
And on that farm he had a duck, E-I-E-I-O
With a quack-quack here and a quack-quack there
Here a quack, there a quack, everywhere a quack-quack
Oink-oink here and a oink-oink there
Here a oink, there a oink, everywhere a oink-oink
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O.
