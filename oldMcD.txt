Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O,
And on that farm he had a cow, E-I-E-I-O,
With a moo moo here and a moo moo there,
Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo moo,
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O.


Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O,
And on that farm he had a cat, E-I-E-I-O,
With a meow meow here and a meow meow there,
Here a meow, there a meow, everywhere a meow meow,
Old MacDonald had a farm, E-I-E-I-O.
